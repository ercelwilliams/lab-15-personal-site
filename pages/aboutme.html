	<p>Welcome, My name is Ercel. A little about myself, I am very interested in sneakers, fashion, and photography. I have been fascinated by these for years and would like to eventually go into these fields. I love putting outfits together and researching different brands and trends. I  also have an interest in wanting to model or become a clothing stylist. I have experience in using programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and Adobe Illustrator. I will like to grow my Adobe program use into video editing as well such as Adobe Premiere and After Effects. I also have intrest in website building and developing my skills for that. Some other personal interests I have include anime,manga, and video games.</p>
